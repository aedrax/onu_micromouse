# ONU Micromouse

This is the code that I used for our robot in the 2015 IEEE Micromouse competition.

Rather than using the Arduino IDE, I used the [Visual Micro](http://www.visualmicro.com/) plugin for Visual Studio. This isn't necessary but it is what all the project files are from.

The robot didn't work in the end, so I can't guarantee the algorithm is even correct
